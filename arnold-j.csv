saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under 
such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.   
will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually 
be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in 
f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec 
length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to 
some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?

So, what is it?   And by the way, don't start with the excuses.   You're 
expected to be a full, gourmet cook.

Kisses, not music, makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

I told you I have a long email address.

I've decided what to prepare for dinner tomorrow.  I hope you aren't
expecting anything extravagant because my culinary skills haven't been
put to use in a while.  My only request is that your stereo works.  Music
makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

Watch the debate if you are home tonight.  I want a report tomorrow...

A couple of issues:

1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm 
restricted right now by issue #1.

Please advise,

pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer 
selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.  Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.  
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.

Hey Buster John,

Despite the X's you received last night for your ill behavior, I wanted to 
thank you for dinner because I had a great time.  Although, I do take 
personal offense to being flipped off at least 5 times in the course of 
dinner. Watch your manners when your with a lady!

I hope you have a great Friday and today is one of your top 5 too!

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility.

Subject: Re Larry May - REVISED


John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st  $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later 
flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the 
market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that 
sucked.

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Regards,

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

John,

I just wanted to update you on some of the things that you wanted me to do:

1. I have ordered your computer and accessories for home use.  Once it comes 
in Jay Webb and Don Adams of IT and EOL will make sure that everything you 
need will be programmed on your computer.

2. I I have ordered your t.v for the office

3. I am working with telerate department on how you will be able to access it 
from your home.

4. Polycom is installed in your office

5. I am still investigating different cellular phone companies


I will get back to when everything is completed.
 
And one question, do you all ready have DSL or any king of internet service 
at home?

John & Mike,

Could you please fill out the attach spreadsheet COB today?  There is one 
swap term and one collar term.

It looks like we are getting close to a finance deal and are working with 
John Thompson in the finance group.  The outline quotes would be a buy out of 
existing deals on Enron's books.

Hi, 

I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help 
me substantiate the EOL commercial.  ABC is threatening not to run it if I 
don't prove that ""Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities 
Market.""  I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time 
with first.  I know we were, but I have to have it in writing.

Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two.

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price.  
I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902.

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly 
identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's 
happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  
It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

Let me know when will be good for both you and John on next Wednesday
afternoon. Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group.
After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to
add all traders into the NT group, so they can use it.

Hi, Brian:

am planning to take vacation on Friday and coming Monday. I will not be
available to show you the demo until next Wednesday if you can't see it
today.

Let me know your schedule.

We spend a tremendous amount of resources and money collecting information.  
Further, the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market.   We have

I run the structuring group at Azurix, but I am emailing you in reference to 
my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City.  Since 
graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New 
York as a local for the last 8 years.  He trades natural gas options and is 
looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can 
discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring.  If this 
would be of interest or not let me know and I will hook you two up.  Thanks 
for your time.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...

We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well 
since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple 
of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates 
so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In terms 
of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too much 
noise in this market to trade differently for me.

I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before.  I
assumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the
19th.  We're still on for drinks after work, right?  By then, you should
have a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?
That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.
Let me know.  Thanks,

John:

The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. My
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural
appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,
particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  market
appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  we
are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be
extremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so
great.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture
is still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of
what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move
to the  upside.

Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly  don't want to
waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something
to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you  check/see your

John- 

What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as 
possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked 
great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without 
getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.

The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. 

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea 
of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.  
I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an 
update of who we are planning to trade with.

Best Rgds,
Caroline"

Russell:
I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks, 
John"

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?"

As far as lunch, it's a done deal.  I need names of people who should be

Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for  
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index  and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.


Thanks

John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
businesses we have created. 

I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
to your emails.  Very masculine!

ps, i hope you can read my sarcasm over email -- if you knew me better, you 
would understand it completely since it is rare that i'm in a totally serious

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how 
you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
produce that effect.  
The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
the winter.

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been
but heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a ""chief"" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny.
Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the
stock price with it.  Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but
I think I just did.

Is this ""the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives""?  If so, you
should write me back after you complete your ""nine hours and $1 billion in
trades"" today!!   Does this mean I have to start calling you ""Mr. John""?!

John, the matrix that was sent to you includes YTD P&L for all the traders in 
the matrix.  Trader P&L contribution to desk P&L, however, was not backed out 
on that particular matrix.  That matrix effectively shows one trader's 
correlation to all others.  What is does not show is one trader's P&L to the 
desk P&L.  I have included a spreadsheet with each trader's P&L backed out of 
AGG-GAS P&L to demonstrate their relationship.  Please call Frank or myself 
if you have questions.  Thanks.

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

John:
?
I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am 
receiving hourly ""9"" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a ""9"" type topping pattern, but one  that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major  
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater  detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me  know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,

asked to meet with him, and their appointment is scheduled for Thursday, 
9/28, at 1:30 pm.   Jeff had also asked that you spend some time with him so

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really 
great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their 
control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could 
have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never 
have done what I've done. 

 Thanks,  
 Jim Schwieger"

I suggest that we initially cover this person out of the Portland office.  
One of our middle marketers can easily get up to meet with this guy.  
Depending on the magnitude and complexity o their power and gas needs are we 
will then pull in the appropriate people.  Phillip and John, let me know if

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

Dave:
A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,
John"

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.   "

Dear all interested volunteer tutors,

There will be an informational meeting on Tuesday September 19th at

match tutors with students in subject areas. The meeting will be here at
the Houston Ballet Academy in the large conference room.

So far we have students who will need tutors in the subjects of:
art, sociology, spanish, geometry, english, earth science, history
(government and world history), women's literature, and algebra II.

Please let me know if you will be able to attend the meeting, as well as
what subject area that you would like to tutor in. If you will not be
able to attend the meeting, but are still interested in being a tutor
please let me know as soon as possible.

The Houston Ballet is located at 1921 W. Bell. The Houston Ballet
Academy faces W. Grey and is inbetween Waugh and Shepherd (next to
Kroger). If you need specific directions please call 713.523.6300. You

JA;
Six months ago we spoke about Tony moving to a commercial role. He followed 
your advice and has gained some experience in structuring. He approached me 
about joining the middle marketing group. I think he would an asset. I think 
we would bring him as an associate with the hope that he would move up to 
manager in 6 months.

Please let me know your thoughts. I would like to use you as a reference with 
Fred and Craig.
Thanks

Please reply confirming you recieved it.
A second message will follow to try and replace some of the address's I know

Thanks for your help

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop."

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is 
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of 
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the 
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.  

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been but 
heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a ""chief"" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??   I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years 
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny.  
Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the 
stock price with it.  Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but I 
think I just did.   
Your long lost buddy,
John

Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan

Hi John,

Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan 
for your cost center - 105894.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 
direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that 
details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and 
a template for the 2001 plan.  

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you 
tomorrow:

1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?
2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?
3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?
4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want 
to plan for?
5) Are you expecting any promotions?
6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement 
agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?
7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?
8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?  If so, how much and where?
9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, 
monitors and software?
10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should 
plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)

My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished 
before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  
Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the 
meeting.

Thanks!
Suzanne"

Hey John,

We'd briefly spoken on the phone last week, but I haven't been able to come 
by and talk to you like I'd promised.  Louise had mentioned you did not like 
Cynthia Kase's newsletter and may not want us to put Cynthia's weekly 
summaries on EnronOnline.

Since Fred (Lagrasta) and his group think publishing her summaries on 
EnronOnline will attract more of the smaller customers, would you have any 
objection over us publishing the Kase newsletters.

Pls. let me know ASAP so we can proceed with this further.

Regds.,

Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about 
how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.  "

Subject: Long Term Volatility

John, Mike,

As you may know I recently moved from the Calgary office to the London 
office. The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the 
front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is 
in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale 
behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price.

Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) 
perhaps before the open or shortly after the close? (The Nymex closes at 8pm 
UK time.)

Thanks,

Dave"

I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this 
power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC 
in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a 
mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them 
with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a 
way to generate false P&L?

Subject: ENA Fileplan Project

Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're 
taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.

Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
Thank you.

Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as 
wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

The roll out for phase II EOL is (for now) 8/28/00. Options are qeued next 
after that. Unfortu ately I wish I could give you a hard date, but it is out 
of my hands and in Jay Webb's shop. I am pushing as hard as I can but Louise 
has set phase II as the priority. I know this sounds like a lame excuse, but 
I don't know what else to say. The application is built, it just needs to be 
tested. Please don't get too frustrated and keep the pressure up on us.

Subject: Reuters Story on E-Exchange


By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business.""
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
""giant matrix"" within the system.
   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.
   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer.""
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business"".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, 
it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system 
not supplying us with that info.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

-Andy"

Planning to attend the Olympics in Sydney, Australia?

Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to 
experience some warm Aussie hospitality.

The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an 
opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one 
of our National Parks close to Sydney.

The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC 
International ""Wine & Wisdom"" event in the form of a Bush BBQ.  The time is 
4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some 
warm Aussie hospitality.

Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social 
or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail.  It's then up 
to you!

When I sort by both counterparty and product at the bottom of the screen, the

That is fine...Just make sure you ensure the confidentiality of the floor is

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

I've talked to him several times in the past.  I told him that you would call 
because of your experience with setting up funds.  They have two main 
problems.   One is setting up their internal systems.  Second, they have 
credit problems with a BBB+.
Please call and introduce yourself.

remember when you said there is a reason they call them bear spreads?

bring up a chart of f/g or g/h.   
f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 99 when ff1 was worth 2.50

Frank:
One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

Subject: Stress Testing

RAC is working on developing some ""canned"" stress tests regarding VaR.  For 
example, one test could be called ""hurricane"", were the prompt month is 
""stressed"" on both price and vols, holding all other inputs constant. 

Anyway, I would like to know of any likely/realistic stress scenarios you can 
think of....

Let me know,

Subject: VaR Methodology Change

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady."

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, 
we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.

any questions please feel free to call.

Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus 
opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's


	

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

Frank:
Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

John,

Please look over this file and let me know if it is okay for us to use it as 
the screen shot that is on all the monitors in the commercial.  Please 
include Ann on your response, as she will be passing it through legal since 
I'm out of the office.

Ann, 
Once he gets this back to you, please run it by Mark Taylor.  If he is okay 
with it, email the final version back to me, because the crew in Toyko needs 
it ASAP.  

Thanks!  Margaret

Margaret -- It's critical that you get John Arnold's permission before using 
the attached spreadsheet and graphs.  They contain curves through July 12th.  
Also, you may want to get legal permission from Mark Taylor.

Hi Kal,
 Here are some screen shots, let me know if they will work for you.  I think 
we may need to double check with John Arnold- the trader- before using them 
for sure.  But I was told they would be okay.

Company Press Release

El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

    (a) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents diluted
earnings
        per share before the impact of certain non-recurring charges.
Second
        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
        pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results
        exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or
        $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
        pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
        issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
        2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
        Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
        related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale
        of assets of $19 million pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the
        resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19
million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies.  
I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable 
and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more 
realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.

Subject: Forward-forward Vol

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Vlady."

Hello,
Bill Perkins of Small Ventures USA is having a party this Saturday at the 
Mercantile bar downtown.  He has rented out the place, has a band, open 
bar...  usually pretty fun.  He asked me to give both of you an invite in 
appreciation of the work you've done for him.   If you have interest, ccmail 
me with whether you need one or two invites each.

because of your experience with setting up funds.  They have two main

Please call and introduce yourself.

Hey Liz,
Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.

My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work 
better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more 
user-friendly.

On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a 
flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for 
half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't 
expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.    
Thanks,
John

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

Subject: VaR

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?

Remember we were trying to figure out the difference in return between tax

it is different, but over 5 years and a 10% growth rate, it doesn't amount to 
much more than the cost of our beer tab.  See attached."

Come by Tuesday between 5:00-5:30 if you still want to see the new 
spreadsheet.  However, it may be more valuable to talk to Dutch Quigley, who 
runs my risk, as he built the system and understands the vertical integration 
better.

Jeff:
Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.

Andy:
The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction."

Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??"

Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens 
if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on 
EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the 
nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?"

The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics 
book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold 
longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market. 
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was 
transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until 
this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's 
position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi"

Hello...
Despite my thoughts, you like baseball.   So the question is do you like art  
(as in musuems)  ?
I'm leaning towards yes but don't know for sure."

Hello:
It is the Blue Men Group.  Two friends highly recommend it.  It's in the 
Astor Theatre on Lafayette in the Village.
43rd should be good.  I think you woul dhave had more flavor in Harlem though

I've been tasked with getting tickets to a show.  Was it 'Blue Men Group'
that you recommended we see?  And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not
as bad as you thought.

Andy:
This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, 
unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between 
numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an 
unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the 
decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until 
the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going 
forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better 
replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change them"

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5."

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share"

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share"

In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company

IMPORTANT MEMO



Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Channel Inside FERC

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it

Subject: RISK Magazine Interview

John:
Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue 
regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's 
opinion of:

1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades
2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer?
3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?

If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me 
know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know 
it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let 
me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. 

Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our

Hey Adam:
sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think 
you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way 
to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get 
close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas 
structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in 
touch,
john

Hi John,

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its
been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened.
But the most important thing has been my decision to join
Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have
time please let me know if you know of anything.

Thanks,

Adam Bayer"

Subject: Fimat (Soc Gen Line)

John - I got a call from Warren Tashnek today.  He is concerned about the 
usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its 
costs.   He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referred 
him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with 
us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please 
address this with him?  

Thanks, Sarah"

Jeff:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:
John"

Arnold,

I am trying to talk via MSN messenger service and it will not accept 
jarnold@enron.com or any other reasonable email path.  What is your official 
email path?  I am assuming that you are using Outlook.  I am here at work 
trying to close a deal.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout 
of the floor.  I will end up having spots on five and six.  Also,  Nelson 
Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the 
Wellhead/Ecommerce effort.  And yes, John will need room to grow. 

What did you think of the article?

remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave 
that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso

may be looking to sell some naked calls soon.  can you check that i would be 
approved to sell 200 of either 65 or 70's expiring somewhere between jul-jan. 
 also, if i sell naked calls with a tenor of more than one year that expire 
worthless, do the gains get counted as LT cap gains?"

John, I have just arrived in Houston, and will be running the LNG Trading & 
Shipping business. I worked for Louise for many years, and took over the 
European Gas business from her when she came over here a few years ago. I'd 
like to meet you and discuss a few issues. Do you have any time over the next 
few days? 

Thanks,
Jonathan"

1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some 
will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation 
i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back 
as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people 
think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes 
out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away 
to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a 
$2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward 
curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will 
end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the 
ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that 
prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact 
that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?


Thanks"

John,

I heard from Wes Colwell that you had been appointed by Lavorato to layout 
the sixth floor for gas.  This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement 
of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six.  I have taken 6 spaces but I need two 
more.  The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied 
by the Central Region.  I would like to move these individuals to two spots 
right across from their current location (e35 & e36).


For your information, the current six spots that I have are :  e17, e18, e21, 
e22, e23 and e24.

Please call when you can.  Good luck trading...

Regards, Mrha"

Please resend the forms needed although I may have sent the necessary docs

Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Hi Julie. I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, ""North

has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and
still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it
was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you 
want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much 
easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out.

Hello Mr. Arnold,

Thank you for speaking with me today with Kenneth Parkhill.  Unfortunately,
none of my teammates are available to meet with you today.  Would you please
review our questionnaire and reply back to me with your comments about the
questionnaire and answers to any questions that apply to your work.

We will follow up with you later this week if we have questions.  Thank you

John,

Sorry again...  my last 2 trades (EOL # 1112587 & 1112596 - I sell 1/2 day 
twice
@5.55 on May) were done again by mistake on US Gas Daily instead of NYMEX.

I have called your help desk to try to remove US Gas Daily from my NYMEX 
screen
which we cannot do so far unless I select each quote individually.  However 
this
would run the additional problem of not showing up new tenors you may 
introduce
over time.

Thank you and best regards,

Herve

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1.    
that's all the juice i'll pay.

Subject: RE: ng views + wager

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So 
around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's 
conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as 
large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front 
frequently.

Subject: SUNRISE CAPITAL

This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They 
concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking 
for liquidity and want to know:

1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like?
2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for 
the front month on swaps and options?
3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone?

They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this
Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded.

I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these 
inquiries.

Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and 
JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the 
trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit 
exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.

Thanks,
CA"

Hi John !

My mistake again early morning...  I clicked on Gas Daily Henry Hub (EOL
#1107435,    I buy 5,000 MMBtu/day  May @ 5.51)  instead of NYMEX.

Could you change it to NYMEX ?

Thank you and sorry again,

Herve

Look what I found: http://www.60thompson.com/

There aren't many photos, but it sounds nice.  Travelocity.com shows
cheaper, promotional rates.  And I'll find out from Paula where she made
her reservations.

I'm done.  It's all up to you now.

i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer 
versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 
and contango for natty?

Subject: Incremental Fuel Switching For Distillate-- Summer Estimate

Given the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is 
1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.  
So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the 
system due to No2 oil usage.

Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.
Thanks,
John"

attending. Make a note for the calander. I'm thinking we can use this to get 
people like Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, etc. to attend an Enron function, 
while also gving the traders an opportunity to go as well.

Hello all,

Over the last few weeks correspondence has been disseminated to you in 
regards to opportunities with the Guggenheim Museum in New York. We need to 
get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event 
at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank 
Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event 
would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enron 
executives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendance 
list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of 
the event (excluding travel arrangements).

We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let me 
know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel 
free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.

Thanks, Margaret"

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle
with John Elway? No.  Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No.

But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have
agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's
capable hands and should be completed next week.

In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday
(3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors.  John Galperin (on our
desk) will introduce Jon.  Try to stay awake during John's introduction."

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M =20


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=

maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent 
historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right 
now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to 
prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your 
markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is 
that relevant.

unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

John, Mike

I work for the London Research team and am looking at 
some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.
Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done 
some fundamental research regarding 
the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.

I would be grateful if you tell me 
what you have done or suggest 
someone else that I could ask.

agree on view. as u cud tell i got a little less bearish for a bit so i delta
hedged and day traded to keep from losing a ton, let go og the delta after aga
number which was exactly on my forecast still implying 7.5 bcf swing(i 
actually
thot it could have been worse so my range pre was 5-12 basis past cupla weeks
aga. that said i with you took my lumps. having a very good month in petro
helped me hold on to natgas shit p&l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be
more patient.
    think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up
traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit.
    what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more
and more)? how come he always seems to be fighting you on this stuff. if he
would go the same way as you(and i) this mkt would just crap. either way im
unwinding-gonna be making a jump soon(thats p&c for the moment). will keep u

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a
more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch
out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.  "

John-

My name is Clayton Vernon, and I am the Manager for Models and Forecasts for 
East Power Trading, reporting to Lloyd Will.

I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for 
EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product 
helpful for you.

In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively 
avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your 
colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are 
between Enron desks.

Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact?

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ"

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

If you want to spend it with me, would you rather go to the beach or

yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the 
loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and 
fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, 
eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second 
puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, 
demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry 
realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you 
should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y 
surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists 
for rest of winter.  by late december, just trying to find a home for gas.  
think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle.

just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me.
weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or
so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a
major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate
weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down.
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying
still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we
haven't moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.
-when we start beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will
get short.  customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us
is we're coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be
strong.  when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of
story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the
mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots
get short.  i continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m
400.

trading results on those as well, including the 5-day and YTD P/L and current 
NOP and VaR on George (Products EOL trading) - and also on _____ whatever 
we're calling the EOL NA Gas auto trader.

Warming Up To Green

BY ERIC ROSTON

Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.

Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you
can't see
your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin
box for the
right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,
Murphy Oil
Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred
thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same
stuff you
exhaled three sentences ago.

The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that
same autumn
day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and
scientists
from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the
zeds and
umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework
Convention on
Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission
of six
gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological
terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was
reached.

In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of
carbon
(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a
Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target
seems a
bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and
there isn't
even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed
there
isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.

Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an
environmental
transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global
bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions
trading
system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to
confront the
climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.
John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and
set up
internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have
vowed
to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto
target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. ""This isn't an act of altruism,"" says
Aidan
Murphy of Shell. ""It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business.""

And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your
neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont
is
pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. ""There's
been a
shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since
Kyoto,"" says
Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Now the view is that
climate
change is serious and we ought to do something about it.""

There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources
and ""cap
and trade"" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas
emission
and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their
allowance or
buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the
pursuit of
greenbacks will fuel greener business. ""Whenever you turn a pollution
cut into a
financial asset,"" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental
Defense,
""people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.""

Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing
the
potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to
consider. Witness
Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global
warming
as solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders
clamoring and
the bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a
quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted
amount of CO2.

Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.

How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogous
to the
one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure
it out,
companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how
you
buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)
how to do
so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. ""It's risky as
hell,"" says
Deming.

Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources
Institute
and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky
by
creating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four
companies--Arthur
Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an
exchange
where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of
legislative
standards. ""They're trying to nail down something that will be useful
under laws
that are not yet defined,"" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an
energy-trading firm.

The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto
Protocol,
and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:
bringing
emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the
current
situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,
have become
its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark
on a
national trading system.

Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for
sequestering carbon
in growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen
into the
air and turn carbon into wood.

The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus
setting up
an early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against
the
document. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard
preliminary
briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,
to be held in
Bonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,
when he
signed legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxide
emissions--the main
ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And
Houston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a
prominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such
market.
So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need that
big a push.

With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for
greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For
you, it's
still free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running
soon. In the
very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an
opportunity.

you agreed to kill EOL Deal #1025253 @ 2:03 PM.  This trade was not confirmed 
to
me by EOL, neither reported into ""Today's transaction"" section.  (Therefore I
entered into a duplicate trade on EOL @ 2:06 PM which we agree on)

Thank you for you cooperation, and best regards,

Herve P.E. Duteil

On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
customers get lost in the crowd?
Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret"

heffner how?
was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything
on the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options.
certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes
tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher
level and if cash rejects higher prices.
will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too
high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in
for some turbulence here

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Andy:
Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

John

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with 
regard to EOL for UK gas.
We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).
Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below. 

Once again, thanks for your help
All the best,

Andy

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret"

agree with contango story .   cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture 
where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also 
back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying 
all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been 
under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should 
result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion.
definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more 
demand back as we sit at these lower levels.  
off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so 
a much needed break.

i wud think apr shud also start to find support from contangos, storage 
players,
ie pretty attractive contangos given the bullsih mkt sentiment, and spec a
little short will eventually roll. i bullspd a little little at 5.5 just for a
scalp. if cash converges which it shud as we fall in px then shud see sprds 
find
support at the 5-6 ct level/month? ?
    other than that-im still bearish-5 bucks not sustainable longer term and
nothing yet telling me otherwise. economy and oil curve also not going to help
ngas. buying 4.00 summer puts
  thanks for comments on utilites-i'll bet they buy all the way down but i 
think
theyll have so much gas coming at em if we stay at these levels the mkt will
ultiamtely force em to back down.
  in ny yest and today-saw the red hot chili peppers last nite , was awsome,

Hi John,

I work in Corp. PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with 
respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to 
know the answer to.  I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are 
and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to 
French power trading.  I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance 
I would greatly appreciate your comments.  

Thanks, Ann

very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough 
on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to 
buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents 
when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though 
it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported 
just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of 
the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year.

Lemuel Green, a flour mill owner, took the excess power from the water-turn=
ed=20
generator at his mill in 1908 and sold it between dusk and midnight to=20
anybody in Alton, Kan. who knew what to do with it. Soon he quit the millin=
g=20
business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o=
f=20
the state. Before his death in 1930 he had built a utility that lit 56 Kans=
as=20
communities.=20
Kansas City's UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourth-generation=20
family-controlled electric utility in the country. Today the outfit, once=
=20
called Missouri Public Service, is headed by Lemuel Green's two=20
great-grandsons.
Richard Green, 46, took over as chief executive in 1985, three years after=
=20
his father's death. At the time Missouri Public Service served 200,000=20
customers in two states and had $245 million in revenues. Richard's brother=
=20
Robert, now 39, joined him three years later.=20
Standing pat was not an option. Deregulation was in the air, and the rules=
=20
were changing. The brothers remade the company. They spent $4 billion buyin=
g=20
utilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20
UtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries=
.=20
More important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In=
=20
1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=
 a=20
two-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading=
=20
operation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as=
=20
valuable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power=
=20
generated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20
""My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be=
=20
competitive in this business,"" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100=
=20
employees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According =
to=20
Natural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=
he=20
country last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=
g=20
from weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20
Problem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20
solution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls ""our 'asset lite'=20
strategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it."" So Aquila may provi=
de=20
the gas to power a so-called merchant plant, one that produces electricity =
to=20
sell in the market, in return for a claim on its production. But so far=20
Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20
business-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg=
y=20
do.=20
What to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=
f=20
Aquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its=
=20
trading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20
Company are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=
f=20
20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=
d=20
spin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20
The timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20
market. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for=
=20
many firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=
e=20
reason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29=
=20
billion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20
But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila=
=20
stock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in=
=20
the capital markets forever. Even with its ""asset-lite"" strategy, the compa=
ny=20
is far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20
versus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai=
se=20
$425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent's $2.=
9=20
billion in debt.=20
If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by=
=20
talking to him. ""We see this company as our heritage,"" he says confidently.=
=20
This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family's share =
of=20
UtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20
Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but=
=20
they might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history. Lemuel sold=
=20
some of his utility assets for $6.6 million in 1927 and diversified into=20
California orange groves. The assets were resold to Samuel Insull, the=20
midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of=20
holding companies collapsed during the Depression. Years later, after=20
Congress reacted with a law that busted up multistate electric utilities, B=

and Rick's grandfather bought back Lemuel Green's utility properties for a=

song.

Two years ago, Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in=20
meteorology, intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form. But just=
=20
before he started working on a doctorate, a very different opportunity blew=
=20
in.=20
Now Mr. Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of M.B.A.s who trade=20
billions of dollars in weather-sensitive energy commodities such as natural=
=20
gas and electricity for Aquila Inc., the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes=
t=20
utility.
With no business background himself, Mr. Hoggatt is also trading complex=20
financial contracts based on his predictions. ""I'm putting my money where m=
y=20
mouth is,"" says the tall, square-shouldered 28-year-old.=20
Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding=20
energy-trading business. While off-target forecasts on television may=20
frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this=
=20
week on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g=
as=20
traders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists=
,=20
a profession that traditionally hasn't paid all that well and is often the=
=20
butt of jokes.=20
From Wall Street to Houston's Louisiana Street, where many energy companies=
=20
have set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a=
t=20
the National Weather Service or in academia. ""The appetite for weather is=
=20
insatiable,"" says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy=
=20
Corp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast=
er=20
to his Houston team in the next year.=20
Enron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double=
d=20
its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking=
=20
talent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,=
=20
competitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students=
.=20
And since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas=
=20
City, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt's alma mater=
,=20
the University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20
climatology.=20
That hiring paid off a bit during this week's winter storm in the Northeast=
.=20
While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a=
=20
pending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20
cities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20
Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20
region at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20
Hoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=
er=20
because of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20
high. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less=
=20
than predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit=
=20
that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20
About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=
s=20
degrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A=
n=20
additional 300 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus=
t=20
a few years ago, those graduates didn't typically have many options: TV for=
=20
those who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or =
a=20
handful of private consultants for those who didn't. Research was an option=
.=20
And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help=
=20
position airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20
Now, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with=
=20
graduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and=
=20
trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th=
e=20
roughly $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with =
a=20
graduate degree.=20
""It's a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20
employment after graduation,"" says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20
atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. ""This is a bit of a switch.""=
=20
So far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly=
=20
because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in=
=20
the mid-1990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,=
=20
about 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20
And the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn't for=20
everyone. When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State, one of the nation's to=
p=20
meteorology programs, he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron. ""It's quite an=
=20
impressive place,"" he says of Enron's trading floor, but he wasn't sure=20
forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade. ""I would be=20
afraid that if money wasn't made in a hurry, I'd be tossed,"" says Mr. Altoe=
,=20
who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Mic=
h.=20
For others, having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art. After=
=20
two years as a manager at the Weather Channel's Latin American division in=
=20
Atlanta, Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the=
=20
American Meteorological Society. Enron called.=20
""Have you heard about Enron?"" Mr. Marquez remembers being asked. ""And I sai=
d,=20
honestly, `No.'""=20
During a visit, Mr. Marquez, a 33-year-old Navy-trained meteorologist, foun=
d=20
Enron's trading floor exhilarating. Enron courted Mr. Marquez heavily,=20
tracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico.=
=20
Mr. Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active=
=20
work place he was looking for. Also, he'd be getting a 10% to 15% boost ove=
r=20
his Weather Channel salary, before potential bonuses from Enron.=20
""I'm getting more money than I would anywhere else,"" he says.=20
Weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicago's earl=
y=20
commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street. Jon=20
Davis, a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago, started=20
forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in 1985.=20
But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are=
=20
able to gauge air-conditioning use in the summer or natural-gas demand duri=
ng=20
the winter heating season. Meanwhile, all sorts of companies are turning to=
=20
energy traders and Wall Street for ""weather derivatives,"" complex contracts=
=20
used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather. ""With every=20
passing year, you do more energy and more energy,"" Mr. Davis says.=20
Despite big advances in data collection and modeling, betting millions of=
=20
dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business. Short-term=20
forecasts are pretty good. Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy.=
=20
Most meteorologists get their data from the government, particularly the=20
National Weather Service. Many then tweak it with their own interpretations=
=20
or forecasting models.=20
Disappointed last year by poor long-term forecasts from 11 private=20
consultants, Aquila has a contest offering $100,000 to the meteorologist or=
=20
team that can best predict temperatures in 13 major U.S. cities over the=20
course of a year. ""I call it the forecast bakeoff,"" says Mr. Hoggatt.=20
The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters. WSI Corp., a=20
Billerica, Mass., weather-forecasting firm, started an energy service last=
=20
year, and Jeffrey A. Shorter, a WSI vice president, says energy clients can=
=20
be less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation, especially whe=
n=20
the forecasts are wrong. But, he adds, ""presumably, more often than not,=20
we're right.""

ENRON PROVIDES TRADING SERVICES TO MANX ELECTRICITY UNDER NETA
2001-03-08 08:43 (New York)


     (The following is a reformatted version of a press release issued
by Enron and received via electronic mail. The release was not confirmed
by the sender.)

ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT

     London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA). Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.
     The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world.
     ""The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us
under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and
we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this"" said Mike
Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.
     ""Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal.""
     Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron,
commented: ""This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well
into Enron's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements.""

Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent, WSJ Says
2001-03-08 06:47 (New York)


     Kansas City, March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The growth of energy
trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
     Weather affects commodities trading and determines
electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and
UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
$60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
     Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
     Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

SINGAPORE: PetroChina plans five gas, products lines by 2005.
By Chen Aizhu

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - PetroChina has mapped out plans for a massiv=
e=20
pipeline gridwork to be in place by 2005 and to ship huge hydrocarbon=20
reserves in China's west to its thriving east, government and industry=20
officials said on Thursday.=20
""A total of five pipelines are planned in the 10th five-year plan=20
(2001-2005), four gas and one for refined oil products,"" a senior industry=
=20
official told Reuters by telephone from Beijing.
Officials estimated total cost of the projects at 50 billion yuan ($6=20
billion) at least.=20
Topping the agenda and the largest of the five projects is the 4,200-km gas=
=20
trunk line winding eastwards from China's central Asian region Xinjiang to=
=20
the Yangtze River Delta.=20
Construction of the $4.8-billion project is set to start later this year.=
=20
Officials said construction would begin with the 1,600-km eastern section=
=20
from Jinbian in northwest Shaanxi province to Shanghai, where initial gas=
=20
supply is expected to land in 2003.=20
The longer western section connecting Tarim to Jinbian is slated for=20
completion by 2005, officials said.=20
PetroChina aims to move between 12 and 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas=
=20
through the trunkline in 2005.=20
HUGE UNTAPPED RESERVES=20
Officials estimated about 720 bcm of recoverable gas reserves remain in the=
=20
Shan-Gan-Ning and Tarim basins. PetroChina's most recent big discovery in t=

PetroChina is hoping to lure foreign firms to invest in the project,=20
including top three oil majors ExxonMobil , Royal/Dutch Shell Group and BP=
=20
Amoco .=20
Also under planning is a three bcm-per-year gas pipeline from Jinbian to=20
Beijing, Hebei and Shandong. Sources said Shell and PetroChina were jointly=
=20
studying the project.=20
A third gas line is planned from Zhongxian in the gas-rich southwest Sichua=
n=20
to Wuhan and Hunan provinces in central China, officials said.=20
U.S. gas and electricity firm Enron Corp is a joint developer in the Sichan=

gas block, which will send supplies via the proposed 740-km line.=20
Sichuan, which produced 7.995 bcm of gas in 2000, is presently China's top=
=20
gas producer, according to official data.=20
The fourth gas pipe, stretching 953-km eastwards from Qaidam basin to Lanzh=
ou=20
in the northwest, is expected to be operational in May with an annual=20
capacity of two bcm, according to Beijing-based industry newsletter China=
=20
OGP.=20
The project, which targets PetroChina's subsidiary refineries in Lanzhou,=
=20
will cost 2.25 billion yuan, China OGP said.=20
LONGEST PRODUCTS LINE TO MOVE OIL SOUTH=20
PetroChina also is set to build a 1,247-km refined products pipeline from=
=20
Lanzhou to oil-thirsty Sichuan to move surplus products out of the remote=

northwest region.=20
A feasibility study for the line, which would be the longest products=20

agreement to ""sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or 
indirectly,any portion of the content of the Website to any third party.""   
They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New 
England.  They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for 
a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the

would refrain from doing it again."

confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction?

cc:  
Subject: rebuttal

I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. 
Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand 
destruction. 
? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are 
underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy 
is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
in service industries.
? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have 
imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly 
entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. 
Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50
? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- 
increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their 
plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the 
bright lights business'
? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom
 First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much 
worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates 
this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar 
which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will 
not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction 
in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this 
is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming 
more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the 
whole story.
? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.

well there's my 2 cents.

Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now 
is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it 
be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short 
term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power,

or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the

or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

   (Recasts, adds details)
    WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand
will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent
growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.
    Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this
year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.
Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.
electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.
    U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was
forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA
said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh
forecast by the agency last month.
    For the entire winter heating season of October through
March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent
from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven
by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst
to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.
    More electricity plants were expected to switch from
natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the
government report said.
    ""This trend is expected to continue through the first
quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price
differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue
through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,
expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep
gas demand for power generation growing.""
    The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased
natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas
supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity
plants.
    California has been fighting all winter to maintain"

theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives 
cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell 
gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so 
much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets 
priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence 
the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he 
talks about it

ECONOMIC VIEW
Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

WASHINGTON -- Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said Saturday. 
The three have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce this week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, the Washington Times reported, quoting 
unidentified sources.
Gordon R. England, 63, who retired recently from General Dynamics Corp., 
would be nominated as Navy secretary; James G. Roche, 61, a vice president at 
Northrop Grumman Corp., is the pick to head the Air Force; and the choice to 
head the Army is Thomas E. White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive 
with Enron Corp. White also once worked as an assistant to Colin L. Powell, 
Bush's secretary of State.

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said yesterday. 
The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with Enron, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Enron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist

Chronicle Staff Writer

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
""It's very unfair,"" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
""He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem."" 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
""Everyone played by the rules,"" Lay said. ""Now our reputations are being 
maligned."" 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
""Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. ""A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea."" 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
""This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,"" said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
""Enron isn't in the business of making markets work,"" Rozsa said. ""They're in 
the business of making a buck."" 
In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. ""It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
""There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants,"" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. ""What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be."" 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
""I have known the president and his family for many years,"" Lay said. ""I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies."" 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
""grossly exaggerated."" 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was ""not 
inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
""We do best in competitive markets,"" Lay said. ""These are sustainable 
markets."" 
TRADING FRENZY 
Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
""Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,"" Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
""There's truly a problem out there."" 
This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, ""The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace."" 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
""These guys are the pariahs of the power system,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost."" 
To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
""California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines."" 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
""I have that concern,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word."" 
For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."" 
As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has Enron signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
""None,"" he said. ""We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs."" 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

Enron boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

03/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.
""Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage,"" Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. ""It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
""We didn't make the rules in California,"" Lay said. ""We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem."" 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was ""not inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories.""

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals
Kathleen Pender

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
B1
(Copyright 2001)

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the ""Sports Illustrated 
curse."" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
""You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business,"" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
Enron (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company ""has been paying us,"" says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. ""We haven't had any 
discussions with them"" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have ""out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves,"" says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The ""10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,"" says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, ""you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes."" 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
""This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,"" says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, ""won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe."" 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
""It was a good move for them,"" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. ""They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work."" 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
""Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well,"" Hinchey says. ""But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps."" 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this 
week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got 
totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all 
the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the 
length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy 
inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, 
just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to 
keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   
With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going 
to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and 
hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  
Leads to more upside potential in short term.  
My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell 
side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales 
have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was 
cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from 
california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   
i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that 
with little downside.  Thoughts?"

so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.
    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.
  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available? thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it 
bt
wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.
  have a good weekdn my man

 if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula

then we start our price data base from bloom berg

I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high.  
That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 
151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.

   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It 
wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.  
Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.

my next aga number is 75-sllitely more than pira and assumes 7.2 bcf/d y on y
s&d swing-the higher prices now the uglier it'll be later.
contmaplating buying some 4.00 puts for lat 2nd q or early 3q for a few 
pennies.
so whaen we go above last years stx in may!!

beleive it or not pero been worse chop fest than gas-all i know is going to
steamboat co skiing next wed-sunday with mans refined prod groups next week so
taking postion down to the stuff i really like, dont have to worry too much

industrial demand the scary thing.  no question there are some steel mills 
and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent 
coming up now and its not due to gas prices.  the economy sucks and it will 
affect ind demand.

at least a myn dollars-need to talk to pira on that. excellant point. need to 
do
some margin analyses . having said all that look at corporate earnings from 
last
year to this year regardless of natgas costs as a feed industrials will be
running slower and consumers just now feeling the pinch as rate increases have
only just recently gotten approved and passed to the likes of us and people 
less
fortunate than us.

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if
you can answer that.

swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is
no-not

 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full

we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate 
stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so 
people don't try to click numbers that are old.  

On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a 
very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  

Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.

I asked them to permission on your stack manager this function. You might

When you have a second I'd like to talk about the broker EOL product and ED F

John -

I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.

I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

- Mike

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present
opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other
ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd
listen.

We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.  At

Michael:
Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other

Michael:
Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

Subject:  Buying back calls


John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer 
buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several

This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to 
Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there 
will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction.  
The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been 
set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg 
has been set.

We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work.  
Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market 
to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no 
weather appears.

the end of the season is typically the best month to hold. Even if the first 
part of the summer is weak, people will be hesistant to sell the back half.  
Same with the winter.  That's why I'm long H2.  It has good correlation with 
the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move.

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers 
should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies.

John,

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was 
under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me 
know what you need to resolve the problem.

Thanks,
Brian

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming"

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  Problem is 
summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 
600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out 
because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to 
blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.  
it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break 
if we're going to run and i don't see that happening.

wish i had a stronger view-my view combined with year end give me just strong
enuf bias not to do anything. its nuts-but you pted out something a while back
is this indistries abilty to keep a contango-we dont have that but they
certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather 
up
front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit
whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left.
    i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in 
march-they
gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em
strong so long as they stay way below ratchets. other thing worries me about 
jan
is cash tite but will steadily get some relief from switching, proocessing
margins negtive , dist, resid, nukes coming up, then on day we come in and 
they
say weather going above normal 1 st 10 days of jan... BAM guess they wack it.

and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a 
dog. i
cant figure out how and when best way to short it/hedge my bet

  dont know-im leaving it alone, the cash makes it a jan/feb a compelling but
too many ifs, yes and dec/jan expirey, wud have thot cash wud recverse the

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to 
put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i 
had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it 
better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like 
to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the 
weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that 
could happen.

was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday?"

thats my approach-i know youre doing well but i have no  idea how well. let me
put it to you this way completely between you and me. i have every expectation
of making myself about a a myn this year(dont want to jinx myself). ive herd
suggestions that this new deal cud be better cuz of the guarantees + bonus. i
dont know yet, hasnt been offered or even discussed directly. but if it does 
and
its very good they gonna need a ngas guy in houston. i think we could put

don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze 
like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash 
such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it 
might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really 
want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though.   
Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as 
california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.

agree guys are short h/j.  hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading 
flat.  agree that it has some squeeze potential though.  Started moving today 
as, simultaneously, march started running up and j aron won a big customer 
deal.  customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.  weather 
frustrating me too.  a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been 
hurt.  Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start 
going crazy again.  Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels.   
Would guess more than 50% has from peak.  Industrial demand different story.  
industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning 
less because of their markets, not fuel costs.  Chrystler is a prime 
example.   Any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to 
domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy.

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274"

Contact Andy Rowe at 713 966 2107.   
They are a medium term fundamental energy player.  They have never indicated 
any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may 
change.  They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval

John- can you give me the name of your business line contact there, job 
function and phone number?  Also, whatever you know about their trading 
style- are they macro, program, technical?  Would they be interested in the 
same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them 
ideas from our various trading groups??  Do they want to trade on-line or are 
they already??

Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I 
can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading...

Talk to you Monday,

John,

The guy from Nymex can not come until next week, Thursday  2/8/01 at 4:00.   
It will last at a minimum of three hours and a maximum of 4 hours (which is 
unlikely).
 There is nothing on your calendar for that day.  Will this day and time work 
for you?  Let me know and then I will send an email out to the desk to make 
arrangements to attend the meeting that day.

Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the 
worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can 
come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good

John - do you mind sharing your Fimat line with the crude traders?  Current 
usage is about $6 million.  Also Warren thought that he might be able to 
change the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.  This change 
would allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they have 
a good rate.)  Warren is going to call you about it.  Sarah"

Tom:
My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an 
extra seat on the jet to Tampa. 

My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New 
York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas 
derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we 
could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights 
would get us back in time.  

Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my 
contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now 
hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if 
your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me 
if the plane were leaving after the game.  

Please advise,
John"

Dear  John,

First of all, congratulations. You have made headlines in Brazil.
Whenever you come to our country, let me know, so I can provide you with
assitance.

When convenient, please let me know Jeff Shenkman's(Enron Global Markets)
email, so I can get in contact.

All the best,

Cacio Carvalho


____________________________________________________

Dear Jeff,
After reading a series of reports on Enron Global Markets,  I decided to get
in contact.
I live in Brazil and had a chance to meet Jim Ballantine whom was(until
recently) heading Enron's operations in Brazil.
Currently, I work as an Strategic Planning Manager at Copergas, a Natural
Gas Distributor located in Northeast Brazil (partly owned by Enron).
Jim once mentioned that EOL intends to come to Brazil. According to the
press, Enron Global Markets will be responsable for expanding the EOL
platform worldwide.

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the 
deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on 
the deal.  
Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical 
deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ"

to the show.

I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great

tickets.  

I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket!

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20

students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

Vince"

a couple of observations from here:
cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Regards,

John,

I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with 
IE 5.0.  Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5.  This is an extremely 
important program that all of the traders will be using.  If you need 
additional resources, I can arrange for this.  Just let me know what you 
need.  

These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version.

Thanks,
Brian"

Glad to hear progress is being made.
I went to Vandy but a little later... 1992-5.

Significant progress was recently made between Enron's and Salomon Smith
Barney's counsels.  We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be
used for both original and variation margin.  With these elevated NYMEX
margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some
of the small issues where we both share some exposure.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead
investment banks.  The relationship is so sound, we will work out the
wrinkles.  I'll be in touch.

P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?"

I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,

Thanks for the inquiry.  I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up.  
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here.  He is very valuable to me and ENA.  Please let me 
know.

Subject: Site Location Advisory Service




I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service
providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location
Advisory Service.

With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We
are finding that more and more US corporations are looking north as they are
faced with fewer satisfactory location alternatives in which to expand.
Canada, with its relatively large and well trained work force, not to
mention lower operating costs, is increasingly being considered by companies
such as yours.

Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is
a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor
force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive
negotiations.

Should you be considering expanding your operations and interested in
discussing our service, please give us a call.  More and more United States
firms, from call centers to manufacturers are locating in Canada to serve
both their US and Canadian customers.

Based in Moncton, New Brunswick Canada, I can be reached at:

Subject: Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz  

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday!  I'll be here next week.

Caroline"

Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time.  Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday.  We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.
good holidays,

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

Sorry it's been so long since I could respond.  With the craziness here I am 
way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  
#3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.  
calendar 2009-2013  very rare that it trades.

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of ""price discovery"" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

See note on switching. It is hard to monitor the distiallte because any

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching."

promotion.  I will follow-up with him after our meeting the first week of 
Jan.  He was ok with everything.  let me know if you need anything else.

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Hi,

If you sent a bank wire on Monday then it should take about 2-3 days to
be credited to your account, but sometimes it takes one or two days
longer.  So, if you don't see it today, please give us a call at 888 304
2206 and ask for either Maria or Juliette in the accounts department and
they will assist you.

Thanks,

WSEX

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas

Adam:
Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer"

It's funny the spreads in gas.  First, in gas, you can play the seasonality 
game.  Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.  No, of course not.  But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.  
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.  
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month.  i can't remember w/o looking at charts.  it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.  i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece.  the z/f/g fly is interesting.  i think 
z/f can and will settle backw.  just a high prob it goes cantango first.
Still seeing sellside interest in term.  definitely a result of pira.  will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve.  previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything.  tired of writing us a big check 
every month.
so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night.  it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy.  they better pay me for the decline 
in my lifestyle .

what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again 
the
numbers but pretty sure they said  +3 bcf by dec. ill let you  know/its been
along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.
    some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.
    your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.
   fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
   good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.
    by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually."

We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference.  We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past.  
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in.  We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
for your participation."
